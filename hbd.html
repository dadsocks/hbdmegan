                        You bring a beautiful unique humor everywhere you go. One of the reasons your humor is unique is
                        that it doesn’t rely on tearing people down. You’re hilarious and loving and kind. Thank you for
                        pursuing us, even when our seasons are crazy, even when we may fail at pursuing you. I’ve always
                        been a fan of you, but truly my love for you exponentially grew after watching how well you and
                        Bill love our girl. There’s something so beautiful, so heart warming, when you watch your
                        friends love the little human you’ve been trusted to raise. It brings tears to my eyes just
                        thinking about how thankful I am that my girl is unconditionally loved by you (and Bill). We
                        can’t put into words just how much it means to us.
                        So thank you for being unapologetically you.
                        <br><br>
                        Thank you for your loving humor, your witty jokes, your presence, but most of all for your
                        unconditional love.
                        <br><br>
                        We are better for knowing you. We are better for being around you. We are better. We love you so
                        much.
                        <br><br>

                        year old body of yours?
                        <br><br>
                        I came across an old journal entry of mine the other day where I was praying for Bill’s future
                        wife. To look back upon those words written so many years ago, I could think of no greater woman
                        for God to send his way.
                        <br><br>
                        Megan, you are true light, filled with such passion, love, and charisma that can only be from
                        God. I can’t thank Him enough for our friendship and how much joy you have brought to my life.
                        Now, you have also brought a whole lot of eye rolling and smirks too, but, it is a true honor to
                        call you one of my closest friends.
                        <br><br>
                        I love you immensely and pray over the next three centuries of your life. May Jesus always be
                        your main focus and may the Holy Spirit’s presence be undeniable inside of you. May He guide
                        your every step and cause you to glorify Him in all you do. May this world be forever changed
                        because of who God has created you to be. (And, may your olive plate be forever full and
                        overflowing!)
                        <br><br>

                        "Two years ago, right here on this spot, I had a recurrent dream, too. I dreamed that I should
                        travel to the fields of Spain and look for a ruined church where shepherds and their sheep
                        slept. In my dream, there was a sycamore growing out of the ruins of the sacristy, and I was
                        told that, if I dug at the roots of the sycamore, I would find a hidden treasure. But I’m not so
                        stupid as to cross an entire desert just because of a recurrent dream.”

                        to listen, slow to speak yet when you do it’s with purpose, meaning and depth. You are

                        all I thank the Lord for our evolution as sisters together. The good, the bad, the growth… The
                        growth and love through the changes - Wow, we have really been through a lot.

                    <br><br>
                    You are the strongest, kindest, and most loving person I know. There is not a single woman on this planet that can match
                    your compassion and pulse on the hearts of others.

                    <br><br>
                    You've pulled me out of tailspins of depression I wasn't even aware of at the time. You've brightned my heart on the hardest days. You've
                    been my source of strength countless times and are my ultimate encourager. I genuinely would be lost without you.
                    <br><br>
                    This past year has been our best yet and I love growing more in Love with you every..single...day!

                    our marriage every day. There's not a single other person on this planet that fits me the way you do.
